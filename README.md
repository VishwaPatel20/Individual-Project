# Lab 5 - Data Analysis with Python

## Description
This project performs data analysis on a salary dataset using Python. It includes:
- Frequency counts for categorical data
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Statistical analysis using NumPy and SciPy

## Getting Started

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Lab5_VishwaPatel.ipynb`) that analyzes salary data.  
The dataset used is `Salaries.csv` (ensure the file is present in the working directory).  

### Breakdown of Tests
This project includes various data analysis tests, including:
- **Frequency Counts**: Analyzes the distribution of categorical variables.
- **Summary Statistics**: Computes measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
- **Data Visualizations**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual insights.

To run the tests, open `Lab5_VishwaPatel.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the code cells.
